# Typography Analysis AI Integration Rules for Typo

## TEMPORARY FOCUS: TYPE SCALE COMPLIANCE ONLY

**CURRENT STATE**: We are temporarily focusing ONLY on type scale compliance (font size counting) to ensure this core functionality works perfectly before enabling other analysis areas.

**DISABLED TEMPORARILY**:
- Hierarchy effectiveness analysis
- Consistency application analysis  
- Readability standards analysis

## OpenAI Integration Specifications

### API Configuration
- **Model**: gpt-4o (latest vision model for maximum precision)
- **Vision Model**: gpt-4o (for image analysis) 
- **Max Tokens**: 4000 for comprehensive typography analysis
- **Temperature**: 0.1 (very low for consistent, precise measurements)
- **Top P**: 0.1 (reduce randomness for measurement consistency)
- **Frequency Penalty**: 0 (don't penalize repeated accurate measurements)
- **Presence Penalty**: 0 (focus on accuracy over variety)
- **System Prompt**: Specialized ONLY for typography design system analysis

### Typography Analysis Focus Areas

#### 1. TYPE SCALE COMPLIANCE (PRIMARY AND ONLY ACTIVE FOCUS)
**Critical Rule**: Maximum 4 different font sizes allowed
- Count exact number of different font sizes used
- Flag any design using 5+ sizes as CRITICAL FAILURE
- DO NOT suggest predetermined scales - analyze what actually exists
- Be extremely precise in font size detection and counting

#### 2. HIERARCHY EFFECTIVENESS (TEMPORARILY DISABLED)
<!-- 
- Does font size correlate with content importance?
- Are the most important elements using the largest sizes?
- Is the hierarchy immediately clear to users?
- Do size differences create meaningful distinction?
-->

#### 3. CONSISTENCY APPLICATION (TEMPORARILY DISABLED)
<!--
- All page titles must use identical font size
- All body text must use identical font size
- All metadata must use identical font size
- All navigation items must use identical font size
- Flag any inconsistent application of same content types
-->

#### 4. READABILITY STANDARDS (TEMPORARILY DISABLED)
<!--
- Minimum 12pt text size on mobile devices
- Minimum 11pt acceptable only for metadata/timestamps
- Check text contrast against background
- Evaluate line spacing and character spacing
- Assess readability at actual device resolution
-->

### AI Prompt Structure Requirements

#### System Prompt Rules
```
CORE MISSION: You are a typography measurement specialist. Your ONLY job right now is to accurately count and identify font sizes in interface designs.

TEMPORARY FOCUS: ONLY analyze TYPE SCALE COMPLIANCE. Ignore all other aspects of typography.

CRITICAL MEASUREMENT REQUIREMENTS:
- MEASURE font sizes by visual comparison - compare text heights pixel by pixel
- Do NOT use template sizes like "32pt, 24pt, 16pt, 12pt" - these are generic defaults
- Do NOT assume standard type scales - observe what is actually visible
- EXAMINE every text element in the design systematically 
- COUNT distinct visual sizes - if text looks different in size, it IS different
- Be EXTREMELY precise: err on the side of finding MORE font sizes, not fewer
- List ALL font sizes you can distinguish in the "detected_sizes" array
- The "font_sizes_detected" number should reflect what you actually count

VISUAL ANALYSIS PRIORITY: Always prioritize what you can visually measure over extracted text data.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: Maximum 4 different font sizes allowed. This is non-negotiable.

FONT SIZE MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE:
- Measure the height of letters in pixels
- Use lowercase 'x' height for reference when capitals aren't available  
- Compare relative sizes between different text elements
- Provide measurements in pixels
- Note any text that appears to use the same size but may have different weights

ANALYSIS PROCESS:
1. SCAN the entire image systematically from top to bottom
2. IDENTIFY every text element visible (headings, body text, labels, buttons, captions, navigation, etc.)
3. MEASURE relative sizes by comparing text heights pixel-by-pixel
4. GROUP text that appears to be the EXACT same size (not just similar)
5. COUNT ONLY distinct size groups - be conservative and precise
6. Score harshly if more than 4 sizes detected

IGNORE FOR NOW: Hierarchy, consistency, readability - focus ONLY on counting font sizes accurately.

REQUIRED RESPONSE FORMAT: Valid JSON only, no additional text
```

#### User Message Template
```
Analyze this interface design for typography compliance:

DESIGN CONTENT: [extracted text and visual data]

FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON TYPE SCALE COMPLIANCE. Count font sizes precisely and evaluate against the 4-size maximum rule. IGNORE hierarchy, consistency, and readability analysis completely.
```

### Response Format Requirements (EXACT STRUCTURE)

### Typography Color Standards Integration
```typescript
const TYPOGRAPHY_COLORS = {
  PRIMARY: '#000000',      // Main content, titles
  SECONDARY: '#666666',    // Supporting content  
  INTERACTIVE: '#007AFF',  // Links, buttons, actions
  DISABLED: '#999999'      // Inactive elements
};
```

### Precise Font Detection Integration

#### PDF Analysis (Primary Method - ACTIVE)
- **Method**: Extract exact font metadata from PDF.js
- **Confidence**: 95% - provides actual font sizes from document metadata
- **Process**: Direct metadata extraction, no estimation
- **Result**: Precise measurements like `14.75px`, `18.0px`, `24.25px`

#### Image Analysis (Fallback Method - ACTIVE)  
- **Method**: AI vision model analysis for images
- **Confidence**: Variable - depends on image quality and text clarity
- **Process**: Visual measurement and estimation
- **Limitation**: Cannot provide pixel-perfect precision like PDF metadata

### Quality Assurance Rules

#### Current Focus Validation
1. **Font Size Counting**: Verify accurate count of distinct font sizes
2. **Measurement Precision**: Ensure realistic font size measurements
3. **4-Size Rule Enforcement**: Strict adherence to maximum 4 font sizes
4. **Template Avoidance**: Ensure no predetermined scales are suggested

#### Monitoring and Logging
```typescript
interface AnalysisLog {
  timestamp: number;
  fileId: string;
  processingTime: number;
  tokensUsed: number;
  detectedSizes: number; // KEY METRIC
  overallScore: number;
  analysisMethod: 'pdf-metadata' | 'image-analysis' | 'ai-fallback';
  confidence: number;
  errors?: string[];
  focusArea: 'type-scale-only'; // Current limitation
}
```

### Integration Testing Requirements (Current Focus)

#### Typography Analysis Tests (Type Scale Only)
1. **Size Detection Accuracy**: Test with known font size samples
2. **Precision Measurement**: Verify PDF metadata extraction accuracy
3. **Conservative Counting**: Ensure we find MORE sizes rather than fewer
4. **Edge Cases**: Very small text, unusual fonts, complex layouts
5. **No Template Bias**: Verify no predetermined scales are suggested

### Key Success Criteria

1. **ACCURATE FONT SIZE COUNTING**: The system must reliably count distinct font sizes
2. **NO FALSE NEGATIVES**: Better to over-count than under-count font sizes
3. **MEASUREMENT PRECISION**: PDF metadata should provide exact measurements
4. **TEMPLATE AVOIDANCE**: Never suggest standard scales like "32pt, 24pt, 16pt, 12pt"
5. **CONFIDENCE REPORTING**: Clear indication of measurement confidence level

**NEXT PHASE**: Once type scale compliance is working perfectly, we will re-enable hierarchy, consistency, and readability analysis.

This temporary focus ensures the core functionality (accurate font size detection) works reliably before adding complexity.
